Adaptations: axes and units converted from millimeters/Z-up to meters/Y-up; translated to rest at the stage; geometry simplified using meshoptimizer with 0.2% relative error limit per structure; normals quantized to signed 16-bit; packed into binary chunks; curated display system groupings and colors. The source contains 2,234 individual OBJ meshes; all remain represented. The combined hierarchy contains 3,432 named FMA concepts, which may reference multiple meshes. Original source identity is preserved in the manifest.

Source OBJ comments mention an older CC BY-SA 2.1 Japan license. The official current database license linked above supersedes that legacy text and explicitly permits redistribution and adaptation under CC BY 4.0.

BodyParts3D represents an adult male reference anatomy based on TARO MRI and anatomical illustration refinements. It is not a complete model of every possible human anatomical structure or variation. This interface is educational and is not a clinical tool.

Adaptations: translated native meter/Y-up coordinates onto the stage, coincident vertices welded and source normals averaged, geometry simplified with a 0.2% per-structure relative error bound, and normals quantized. Colors and display systems are curated for this interface. All 888 source meshes are represented, with 1,073 source nodes available as selectable individual or compound concepts.

This is a reference assembly with whole-body surface and selected organs, including female reproductive anatomy. Its skeleton and muscle coverage is partial. It is not a complete model of every human structure or a single-person scan. Eight placenta/umbilical structures are classified under Pregnancy reference and hidden by default.


## Adaptations in this local fitness atlas

Source commit: 1c38bf35c254a891200d3cedecfd57abebe83d8d
Original application code: Copyright (c) 2026 ashemag, MIT. Full code license is
preserved in human-atlas-MIT.txt. The anatomy data remains CC BY 4.0.

The local atlas selects 238 skeleton structures and 399 skeletal-muscle meshes,
omitting organs, vessels, eye movement muscles and cardiac papillary muscles.
Existing optimized position, normal and index values are preserved exactly;
the buffers are repacked by layer into little-endian binary files with gzip.
Sixteen muscles originally mapped to skeletal/connective display layers are
reclassified as muscular. Original BodyParts3D/FMA identifiers, English names,
bounds and source-system mappings are preserved. Training-oriented anatomical
groups and Chinese display labels are added for selection. A separate optional
body-surface file is repacked from the original Skin structure.

This reference does not include independent meshes for rectus abdominis,
internal oblique, transversus abdominis, latissimus dorsi or quadratus lumborum.
The data is a static adult male reference; it has no animation rig or joint
weights. Any separate action demonstration is an illustrative reconstruction.
